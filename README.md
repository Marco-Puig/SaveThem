A Musical Chairs inspired Game where the last person to earn a earpiece in a round is tackled as President and elminated by the then earned earpiece Security Guards!

## Description
A game where there is a room of players fighting to get an earpiece, and the one player who doesn’t get the ear piece gets tackled. Where the ear piece is for security guards and the person who can’t get one is the president and gets tackled. “Mr.President get down” sort of thing. Pretty much like musical chairs but where a player is eliminated every round until there is only one left.

## Platforms
### Web Release
- Release on a website called SaveThem.io, with the official release being built using WebGL.
### Mobile Release
- Potentially a Mobile release, this would be fun to play on a phone in the sort of way Among Us is.
